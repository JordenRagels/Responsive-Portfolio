            <p id="contentInfo">
                My mistress with a monster is in love.
                Near to her close and consecrated bower,
                While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
                A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
                That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
                Were met together to rehearse a play
                Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
                <p>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</p>
                Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
                Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
                When I did him at this advantage take,
                An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
                Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
                And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
                As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
                Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
                Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
                Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
                <p>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;</p>
                And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
                He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
                Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
                thus strong,
                Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
                For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
                Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
                things catch.
                I led them on in this distracted fear,
                And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
                When in that moment, so it came to pass,
                Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
